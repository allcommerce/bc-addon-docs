# Display Bundle Product Tabs on a Product Detail Page

To display associated products or products by category on a Product Detail Page (PDP), follow the instructions below:

## Instruction

1. Start by creating custom fields to define the categories or specific product IDs to be shown in each tab. You will create either category-based fields or product ID-based fields.

    **Category-based fields:**

    - Create custom fields `__tab_1_category_id` to `__tab_6_category_id`.
    - Assign a category ID to each field, representing the category from which you want to display products.

    **Product ID-based fields:**

    - Create custom fields `__tab_1_product_id` to `__tab_6_product_id`.
    - Enter the product IDs separated by commas in each field, indicating the specific products you wish to display.

Please refer to the screenshot below for guidance on adding the custom fields.

5. Save the changes made in the Theme Editor.

6. On the Product Detail Page (PDP), the bundle product tabs will now be displayed, showcasing the associated products or products from the specified categories.
